# MUSA-611-Midterm
Midterm Project for MUSA 611

This project seeks to show the spatial patterns of police stops in Minneapolis. It shows this through three different types of stops: Suspicious Person, Traffic Law Enforcement and Suspicious Vehicle. Additionally, it shows spatial patterns of stops by race including Black, White and East African people. This data was taken from [Open Data Minneapolis](https://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/police-stop-data/geoservice?geometry=-0.170%2C-5.468%2C-93.159%2C48.789). The dataset used was subset significantly from the original data. The motivation behind this project was to examine the presence and type of police stops both before and after the murder of George Floyd on May 25th 2020. While this has not been accomplished in this midterm assignment, it leaves much to be improved upon for another project. 

Other next steps include:
1. Coloring markers by race or problem to see points together on a map.
2. Create a choropleth basemap to show concentrations of racial groups throughout the city.
3. Adding a pop up box that display other data information when one clicks on the marker.
4. Using the element of time to see how data points changed around May 25th.
